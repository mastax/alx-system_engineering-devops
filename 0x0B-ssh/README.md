# ALX School Project: Connecting to Your Ubuntu Server

Welcome to the ALX School project where you will learn how to connect to your Ubuntu server using SSH with an RSA key pair. This README.md will guide you through the setup and resources needed to successfully complete this project.

## Overview

Alongside this project, you have been provided with an Ubuntu server located in a remote datacenter. Unlike previous levels, you will connect to this server using SSH and an RSA key pair instead of a password. Your server has already been configured with the public key created in the first task of a previous project, which can be found in your intranet profile.

## Server Details

To access your server, refer to the "My Servers" section on the intranet. Each line contains the IP address and username necessary for SSH connection.

- **Ubuntu Version**: 20.04 LTS

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain knowledge in the following areas:

- Understanding the concept of a server and its typical location
- Basics of SSH and its importance in secure remote connections
- Creating an SSH RSA key pair
- Connecting to a remote host using SSH RSA key pair authentication
- Advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `/bin/bash` in script execution

## Resources

Before starting, review the following resources to deepen your understanding:

- [What is a (physical) server - text](#)
- [What is a (physical) server - video](#)
- [SSH essentials](#)
- [SSH Config File](#)
- [Public Key Authentication for SSH](#)
- [How Secure Shell Works](#)
- [SSH Crash Course](#) (Watch at x1.25 speed or above)
- [Understanding the SSH Encryption and Connection Process](#)
- [Secure Shell Wiki](#)
- [IETF RFC 4251](#) (Description of the SSH Protocol)
- `man` pages for: `ssh`, `ssh-keygen`, `env`

## Requirements

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **File Endings**: All files should end with a new line
- **README.md**: A comprehensive guide at the root of your project folder
- **Executable Scripts**: All Bash scripts must be executable
- **Shebang Line**: First line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- **Comments**: Second line of all Bash scripts should explain the script's purpose

## Copyright & Plagiarism

- Solutions to tasks must be original to fulfill learning objectives
- Avoid plagiarism; any form will result in removal from the program
- Do not publish any project content
